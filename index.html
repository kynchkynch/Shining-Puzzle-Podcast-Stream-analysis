<h2>Ⅰ. Summary of Stream</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    The live-streamed podcast premiered on February 10, 2023, from 2:10 pm to 3:30 pm
            pm (GMT+8) via the Facebook page of Shining Puzzle Podcast. The topic of the stream 
            was “My YouTube Video Got Taken Down for No Reason.” One of our main objectives 
            was to give the audience general information about the Digital Millennium Copyright Act 
            of 1998, its impact on society and content creators, and several tips and ways to avoid 
            copyright. Having copyright strikes as a content creator is one reason videos get taken
            down. Another topic we tackled was why inappropriate YouTube videos don’t get
            removed swiftly, specifically videos relating to the YouTube phenomenon called 
            ElsaGate. We delved through the following subtopics: What was it about and why it 
            videos don’t get taken down, and why do content creators post inappropriate videos often
            when they know it doesn’t follow the guidelines of YouTube.
        <br>
        <br>
    Aside from addressing the main topics of the podcast, we had an intermission of 
        playing the drums from one of our hosts, had short “commercial breaks” between the 
        topics to give the viewers a dance number, and gave out two YouTube Premium 
        subscriptions to boost engagement and excitement among viewers.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

<h2>Ⅲ. Summary of Stream</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Since it was the first time the hosts did a podcast, they needed improvement 
            when stating their thoughts and ideas, for the audience to understand the topics better.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Some of the hosts weren’t able to shout out the viewers since the Facebook
            livestream wasn’t open on their devices.  </li>
            <br>
        <li>livestream wasn’t open on their devices. </li>
        <br>
        <li>We didn’t do a trial of streaming on YouTube and Facebook simultaneously,
            because we were unaware that it wouldn’t work. The result is that we were unable 
            to stream on YouTube. We were able to stream only on Facebook. 
        </li></ul>
       <br>
       <br>
       In conclusion, the team needs improvements when it comes to preparedness and
        the way of delivery of the topics. The hosts should be further prepared before going live 
        and open the necessary tabs on their devices. On the other hand, nervousness affects the 
        way the hosts deliver the ideas needed. The remedy for this is for the hosts to have 
        frequent talks about     to be more comfortable with each other and record their 
        discussions to see what else they can improve when talking to each other. For our 
        microphone audio, the team plans to experiment with different microphone placements or 
        look for a better microphone alternative to suffice the need for further clarity of the host’s 
        voices. The team also plans to do a proper test of the simultaneous stream a few days 
        before our live stream so that the team has enough time to take care of any issues that may occur.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
<h2>Ⅳ. Level of Engagement During the Stream </h2>
    <br>
    <br>
        The team can conclude that they had high levels of engagement during the stream. 
        From start to finish, the comments section was lively. The intermission drum cover of one 
        of our hosts, short “commercial breaks,” and the raffle all contributed to this high level of engagement. </p>

        The hosts frequently checked who commented and, when it was the right time, gave the 
        commenters the attention they needed. This factor helped keep the high level of
        engagement consistent from start to finish.

<h1 style="color:rgb(193, 68, 68);"></p>l. Brief Summary</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p style="color:rgb(239, 115, 115);"></p>The Shining Puzzle podcast had a second episode of their podcast and the topic of the livestream was “The advantages of YouTube for students” and it premiered on April 19, 2024, from 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm. The chosen topic is related to how the hosts study independently as students at Apec Schools Sta Rita, as well as how the Apec schools tackle lessons. The objective of this second podcast is to provide information about what makes YouTube stand out from other apps and how it is certainly helpful for students when it comes to studying. 
    Additionally, the podcast tackled how YouTube is helpful for a lot of people since it provides a wide variety of information, and the hosts shared their own YouTube experiences.
    <br>
    <br>
    Before presenting the main topic of the podcast we had a quick intermission of the host playing instruments (Guitar, ukelele, and beatbox). The Shining Puzzle Podcast wanted to give entertainment to our viewers and also to share the talents of our hosts, it is also connected to our topic since we used YouTube to learn the chords of the instruments. For the podcast to have a lot of viewers we use Kahoot for our quiz game and will give out tech accessories and school supplies for those who will win the quiz game, the topic discussed in the podcast is used to create the questions for the quiz game.

<br>
<br>
<ul>
    <p style="color:rgb(239, 115, 115);"></p><li>The hosts explained well the topic of why YouTube is helpful for a lot of students and gave some tips for the viewers about how to fact-check on YouTube.</li>
    <br>
    <li>The hosts were lively sharing their insights and entertained the audience well.</li>
    <br>
    <li>The host had each camera set up and its transition was smooth. The camera in the live was good quality.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Also, the hosts had each microphone for the clear audio and it went well. All of the hosts were audible.</li>
    <br>
    <li>The stream design works and looks good with the setup.</li>
    <br>
    <li>All the transitions were smooth and it made the livestream look good.</li>
    <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   </ul> 
    In conclusion, we improved everything that needed to be improved and everything went the exactly we wanted it to when it comes to improving the quality of the camera and the audio quality.
     Also, all of the objectives of the live stream were delivered successfully and went well as we planned it.

    <h1 style="color:rgb(193, 68, 68);">lll. Areas of Opportunity</h1>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<p style="color:rgb(239, 123, 123);"> <li> We weren’t able to do a dry run of streaming on Facebook, because it worked the last time that we streamed. The result is we were unable to livestream on Facebook. And we were only able to live stream on YouTube.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Since we were unable to do our stream on Facebook, followers were unaware that we streamed on YouTube since we were also unable to post another promotional material that would inform them that we were going to do our live stream on YouTube.</li>
    <br>
    <li>The hosts were unable to talk casually before the stream, making one of the hosts excluded during the stream.</li>
    <br>
    <li>The second stream had low levels of engagement due to the delay and not posting another promotional the followers were unaware, another cause of low viewers is there are only a few subscribers on our YouTube channel.</li>
    <br>
    <li>We changed our seating arrangements but we missed out on changing the names in our design template, so the viewers got confused about it.</li>

    <br>
</ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    In conclusion, the team needs to talk about what topics they will tackle so that no hosts are left out because other hosts discussed topics they aren't planning on, and due to the delay, the team must post new promotional material to keep followers informed, as well as have a dry run. Even if already a delay the team must check everything to be checked to be sure that nothing wrong. They must have a backup plan in place so that they can deal with any errors.

    <h2>Ⅳ. Level of Engagement During the Stream </h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    The team can conclude that the live-streamed podcast had all-in-all high levels of engagement.</p>
    <br>

        <img src="analysis jpg..png"width="40%" height="40%">
    </center>
<h3> Figure 1. The Number of Live Engagements </h3>
<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the total number of chat messages is 149, while the total number of reactions is 239. The total number of live engagements sum up to 388.  Compared to our previous stream on February 10, 2024, the total chat messages of our latest stream are lower, but the total number of reactions is higher. As seen in the graph contained in Figure 1, our peak amount of live engagements was at the 39-minute mark, which had a total of 74 live engagements. 
The total number of live engagements may be lower than our previous stream, but 388 is still a high number, considering it was our first time podcasting live on the YouTube platform. 

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Ⅴ. Viewership</h2>
<br>
The team can conclude that the live-streamed podcast had low viewership.

<br>
<h3>  Figure 2. The Number of Concurrent Viewers</h3>
<br>
As shown in Figure 2, the peak amount of concurrent viewers is 13, while the average is 7. The concurrent viewers peaked at 13, 2 times. The team concluded that the live-streamed podcast had low viewership since these numbers were very low. Streaming on YouTube may be one reason why the team had low viewership. 
For our previous stream, podcasting live on Facebook was more reachable to our friends, family members, and general followers since most of them would be scrolling through their news feeds and seeing that live-streamed podcast immediately playing as they scroll. They end up watching the live stream. In contrast, when the team streamed on YouTube, even if we reshared our stream on the Facebook news feed for our family, friends, and general followers to see, they would have to click on the link to watch the live stream, which is more hassle for some people.
 It won’t immediately grab their attention. Another factor may be that the team was not able to notify their followers about their abrupt shift from Facebook to the YouTube platform. The team was not able to post an announcement on their social media pages that their stream would be moved from Facebook to YouTube at an adjusted time slot.
